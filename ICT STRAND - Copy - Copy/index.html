                    <p>"I believe I am a computer freak or a technology obsessive. I believe I am on the right track in choosing the ICT strand. I believe myself to be technologically addicted. When I wake up, the first thing I do is look at my phone. Because I live in a sophisticated society where we can't survive without our electronics, my interests and passions are all about advanced technology. So, using ICT, I build learning experiences in this professional strand."</p>

These skills and knowledge will assist students like myself in paving the route for a bright future."</p>

            <h5>Overview</h5>
            <div>
                <p>The Technical-Vocational Livelihood (TVL) Track of the K-12 curriculum includes the Information Communication and Technology (ICT) Strand. ICT strand topics aim to educate students information technology ideas and abilities. Students will learn how to create programs and design websites as part of the ICT curriculum. This will also help students develop their animation and illustration talents, allowing them to prosper in the creative profession. If you wish to pursue IT-related courses in college, taking ICT strand topics is a fantastic place to start. So, what are you holding out for? Come and select the ICT strand when you enter SHS!</p>

            <h5>Subjects in this Strand</h5>
            <div>
                <p>This strand will introduce you to three major subjects: computer programming, empowering technologies, and technical drafting. These are necessary if you intend to work in a larger organization where knowing merely programming is insufficient. Other subjects included in your selected strand are Earth and Life Science, General Mathematics, Komunikasyon at Pananaliksik sa Wika at Kulturang Pilipino, Oral Communication in Text, Physical Education and Health 1, and Understanding, Culture, Society and Politics. As a result, your understanding will be challenged, your abilities will be tested, and your intellect will be polished with the help of this subject.</p>

            <h5>What can you do after SHS?</h5>
            <div>
                <p>If SHS graduates from the ICT Strand are passionate about technology, studying anything linked to their selected strand will be good. The strand of the BSc in Information and Communication Technology prepares you for a career in information and communication technology. It provides you with extensive knowledge of computer systems, programming, web page design, and basic animation. This will increase their chances of being recruited as soon as they join the workforce. Taking the ICT strand in senior high school would therefore provide more students the opportunity to pursue a profession in the developing industry of IT.</p>
